        <p class="lead mb-4">Hi, my name is Trevor Loue and Iâ€™m from San Francisco. I was born and raised there since 2001. I am 19 years old and my birthday is January 16, 2001. I am a first year at UC Riverside. I am currently at sophomore standing and Iâ€™m planning to graduate on June 2022. After graduation I plan to take my CPA exam to become CPA certified. I have an older sister who is also an accountant and was part of the reason why I wanted to become an accountant. The rest of my family also has a degree in some sort of business field.<br><br>

        Some hobbies I have are baking, fishing,and running. I like to bake with my mom because it is a son and mom bonding activity. We bake macarons, sponge cakes, and oatmeal raisin cookies. We have struggles with all of those, but mostly with macarons because those tend to easily crack. It took us multiple tries until we finally had a perfect tray of uncracked macarons. When we got that tray we were really happy and excited. The thing we can bake the best are madeleines. Those only take us 15 minutes to make and we like to add our own little twist to it which is to add lemon zest to give it a little zing. I like fishing because there is a lot of excitement trying to reel up a fish when you have no idea what they will do. I go fishing on the pier with my uncle and I go out on the boat with my grandpa. I like to run because I always liked to be fast and feel the wind go against my skin. I did cross country and track and field all 4 years I was in high school. I did distance my freshman and sophomore years and then switched over to throwing my junior and senior year.<br><br>

        I worked at KFC and Taco Bell since summer of 2017 and worked there until the end of the summer of 2019. I worked as a team member which consisted of cashiering, packing, and cooking. I learned interpersonal skills working with many different coworkers. Teamwork was also a skill I got stronger in. Everyone works at a different speed, so being able to adapt to everyoneâ€™s speed is a great way to improve my teamwork and become more efficient as a whole. I also worked on my communication skills with the many different customers I had to talk to. While being on Lowellâ€™s Track and Field team I participated in volunteering. I helped set up barriers for the race so that runners had a clear idea of where to go and show bystanders where they canâ€™t enter. I also guided runners which way to go when they were running on trails and we had to guide them by hand with flags. To keep morale up I handed out food to other volunteers who were helping guide runners or helping others with directions such as where the start and finish lines are.
